# Sinatra - Tic-Tac-Toe

###Dev Bootcamp Week 6 Team Project


This is a 2 player Tic-Tac-Toe game that we built during week 6 of Dev Bootcamp. It allows two players to play one tic-tac-toe against each other from different computers.


The coolest aspect about this app was learning how to use the Javascript to create a multiplayer experience. What we did was set that JS up so that when it was one player's turn we were pinging the server on a regular interval checking to see if a turn was taken. When the turn was taken we switched control to the second player, and started pinging the server for the first play. 


This challenge was one of the early introductions to using more advanced Javascript techniques and learn more about OOJS.
